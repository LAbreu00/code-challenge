You are given an array of positive integers arr. You'd like to know how many triangles can be formed with side lengths equal to adjacent elements from arr.

Construct an array of integers of length arr.length - 2, where the ith element is equal to 1 if it's possible to form a triangle with side lengths arr[i], arr[i + 1], and arr[i + 2], otherwise 0.

Return the resulting array of integers.
