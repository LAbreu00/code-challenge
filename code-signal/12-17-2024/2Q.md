Q1

Given an integer n, your task is to calculate the alternating sum of its digits. In other words, add up all the digits, taking the first digit with a positive sign, the second digit with a negative sign, the third digit with a positive sign, etc.

For example, if n = 52134, the answer should be 5 - 2 + 1 - 3 + 4 = 5.

Example

For n = 52134, the output should be solution(n) = 5.

5 - 2 + 1 - 3 + 4 = 5

For n = 12345, the output should be solution(n) = 3.

1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 = 3

For n = 104956, the output should be solution(n) = -5.

1 - 0 + 4 - 9 + 5 - 6 = -5

Q2

You are given an array a containing a list of strings. Your task is to construct an array of the same length, where the ith element is a 2-character string formed by the first character of a[i] concatenated with the last character of a[i + 1].

If there is no a[i + 1], cycle back to the beginning of the array. In other words, for the final element, concatenate the first character of a[a.length - 1] with the last character of a[0].

Return the resulting array of 2-character strings.

Example

For a = ["cat", "dog", "ferret", "scorpion"], the output should be solution(a) = ["cg", "dt", "fn", "st"].

For a = ["I", "have", "a", "nice", "surprise"], the output should be solution(a) = ["Ie", "ha", "ae", "ne", "sI"].

For a = ["singularity"], the output should be solution(a) = ["sy"].
